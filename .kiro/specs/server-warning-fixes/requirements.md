# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature addresses the compilation warnings in the Rust server application. The server currently generates 38 warnings during compilation, primarily consisting of unused imports and unused variables. These warnings should be resolved to maintain clean code quality and prevent potential issues in the future.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the server code to compile without warnings, so that I can maintain clean code quality and easily identify real issues.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the server is compiled THEN the system SHALL produce zero compilation warnings
2. WHEN unused imports are identified THEN the system SHALL remove them from the codebase
3. WHEN unused variables are identified THEN the system SHALL either use them appropriately or prefix them with underscore to indicate intentional non-use

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to maintain functional code while removing warnings, so that no existing functionality is broken.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN warnings are fixed THEN the system SHALL maintain all existing API functionality
2. WHEN imports are removed THEN the system SHALL ensure no compilation errors are introduced
3. WHEN variables are modified THEN the system SHALL preserve the original logic and behavior

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the warning fixes to be systematic and comprehensive, so that all warning categories are addressed properly.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN fixing unused imports THEN the system SHALL remove all 27 unused import statements
2. WHEN fixing unused variables THEN the system SHALL address all 11 unused variable warnings
3. WHEN the fix is complete THEN the system SHALL verify that `cargo check` produces no warnings
